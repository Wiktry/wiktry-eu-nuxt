My personal website, hosting the things I create for the web.

## Technologies

The website is built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), using the third release candidate of [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/). I'm also using [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), exclusively for icons, [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management, and [Vueuse](https://vueuse.org/) for some of its fantastic composables, all hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). I'm also using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for the back-end, hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
